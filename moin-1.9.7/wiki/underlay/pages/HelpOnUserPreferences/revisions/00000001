= User Preferences =

This page describes how you can change the user defaults of the wiki. Not all options may be changeable if the fields have been disabled by the wiki administrators (see HelpOnConfiguration/UserPreferences for additional infos).
After you have logged in (see HelpOnLogin), your name will be displayed in the navigation area.

<<Action(userprefs,User preferences)>> (available via the "<<GetText(Settings)>>" link in the navigation area of the page) are split in several parts:
 * '''"<<GetText(Change password)>>"''' – form for password updating;
 * '''"<<GetText(Notification)>>"''' – subscription notification configuration (see also HelpOnSubscribing and HelpOnNotification);
 * '''"<<GetText(Preferences)>>"''' – different options related to user-specific MoinMoin appearance and behaviour.
 * '''"<<GetText(Switch user)>>"''' – temporarily authenticate as another user. Available only to [[HelpOnSuperUser|superusers]].
 
Description of options listed in section "<<GetText(Preferences)>>":
 * '''<<GetText(Name)>>''': Either your real name or an alias. Best is to use WikiName format. Must be unique.
 * '''<<GetText(Alias-Name)>>''': If your login name (see above) is cryptic due to technical reasons, you can give your real name here. It will be only used for display purposes.
 * '''<<GetText(Email)>>''': Your email address, this is required if you wish to subscribe to wiki pages or wish to have a forgotten login data mailed to you. Must be unique.
 * '''<<GetText(Jabber ID)>>''': User's XMPP ID (if there is any) - can be used for notifications, see more on HelpOnNotification. Must be unique.
 * '''<<GetText(User CSS URL)>>''': If you want to override some of the wiki system's css, put your own CSS here (UTF-8 or ASCII).
 * '''<<GetText(Editor size)>>''': This controls the size of the text area when you edit a page. Adjust this to suit the size of your monitor and your personal preferences. If set to 0, the size of the text box is adjusted automatically (avoids double scrollbars).
 * '''<<GetText(Preferred theme)>>''': choose a theme to change colours, icons and layout of the wiki
 * '''<<GetText(Editor Preference)>>''': the editor you prefer, either "text" or "gui"
 * '''<<GetText(Editor shown on UI)>>''': which editor(s) are shown on the user interface, either "<<GetText(free choice)>>" – both editors are available via UI – or "<<GetText(the one preferred)>>" – only the preferred editor is available.
 * '''<<GetText(Time zone)>>''': ...
   * '''<<GetText(Your time is)>>''': If the correct time is not displayed, use the drop down box and select the correct time.
   * '''<<GetText(Server time is)>>''': Displays the server time.
 * '''<<GetText(Date format)>>''': The default of year-month-day is least confusing for international use.
 * '''<<GetText(Preferred language)>>''': The default is taken from your browser setting. It is advisable to set this to a specific language anyway, since then you get notification mails in your native tongue, too.
 * '''<<GetText(General options)>>''': ...
   * '''<<GetText(Add spaces to displayed wiki names)>>''': If checked, makes '''Wiki``Names''' look like '''Wiki Names'''. DEPRECATED.
   * '''<<GetText("After login, jump to last visited page")>>''': If checked, jumps to the last page in your trail after login.
   * '''<<GetText(Disable this account forever)>>''': If checked, you can't login again with this account. Think first. :)
   * '''<<GetText(Open editor on double click)>>''': Handy if you edit a lot of pages. See also [[HelpOnEditing#EditorOnDoubleClick|additional infos on HelpOnEditing]].
   * '''<<GetText(Publish my email (not my wiki homepage) in author info)>>''': in case you have no wiki home page.
   * '''<<GetText(Remember login information)>>''': When you set this, the cookie won't expire at midnight.
   * '''<<GetText(Show comment sections)>>''': When checked: show comments (and toggle to comments off), otherwise do not show comments (and toggle to comments on).
   * '''<<GetText(Show fancy diffs)>>''': Makes diffs more readable.
   * '''<<GetText(Show icon toolbar)>>''': Provides a row of icon links in the upper right corner (theme-specific; most useful for old, pre-1.6 themes).
   * '''<<GetText(Show page trail)>>''': Lists the last five pages visited at the top of the page, so you can jump back several pages easily (theme-specific).
   * '''<<GetText(Show question mark for non-existing pagelinks)>>''': Display a highlighted '''?''' in front of a non-existent page instead of a color-coded page name.
   * '''<<GetText(Show top/bottom links in headings)>>''': If checked, every title bar will have an up and down arrow to navigate to top or bottom of page.
 * '''<<GetText(Quick links)>>''': Overrides the standard choices in the gray navigation bar at the top of the page.  Enter one Wiki page name per line. You may also add free-form links, i.e. entries of the form `[url linktext]` just like in wiki pages.

Description of options listed in section "<<GetText(Notification)>>":
 * '''<<GetText(Subscribed events)>>''': configuration of notification methods (currently only "<<GetText(Email)>>" and "<<GetText(Jabber)>>" are available) should be used for informing about different types of wiki events.
 * '''<<GetText(Subscribed wiki pages<<BR>>(one regex per line))>>''': Enter '''`.*`''' to receive an email when any page in this Wiki changes (''not recommended'' for busy wikis), or enter the names of any individual pages, one per line.  If you are familiar with '''regular expressions''', you may enter a regex expression to match the pages names of interest (.* matches all page names). You can also just click on the <<GetText(Subscribe)>> link or icon in the theme when viewing the page you want to subscribe. For more details please see HelpOnSubscribing.

{{{#!wiki caution
Subscription notification is an optional feature that only works when email support/jabber bot has been enabled for this wiki, see HelpOnConfiguration/EmailSupport and HelpOnNotification for details.
