You can use regular expressions and other search modifiers (see HelpOnSearching), e.g. :

{{{regex:seriali[sz]e}}}

Or you can go directly to a page, or create a new page by entering its name here:
  <<GoTo>>

If you like to browse manually, good starting points to explore a wiki are:
 * RecentChanges: see where people are currently working
 * TitleIndex: a list of all pages in the wiki
 * WordIndex: a list of all words that are part of page title (thus, a list of the concepts in a wiki)
 * WantedPages: a list of linked, but not existing pages
 * OrphanedPages: a list of existing, but not linked pages
 * AbandonedPages: a list of pages that have seen no changes for long
 * RandomPage: some random pages
 * PageSize: size statistics
 * PageHits: hit statistics

You can navigate to other wiki pages related to the current page by selecting these actions, available through the dropdown lists in the edit bars at the top and/or bottom of each page:
 * <<GetText(Like Pages)>>
 * <<GetText(Local Site Map)>>

Additionally, there are the {{{<<PageList>>}}}, {{{<<FullSearch(...)>>}}}, {{{<<Navigation(...)>>}}}, and {{{<<TableOfContents>>}}} macros, which allow you to automatically generate indices for cohesive parts of a wiki (see HelpOnMacros).
