= Groups =
<<TableOfContents>>
A group is a simple data structure that maps a group name to a set of group member names. It can be used e.g. within ACL definitions to specify groups of users.

The group name usually is something like `EditorGroup` (some word ending with `Group`). This default pattern can be changed (e.g. for non-english languages etc.), see page_group_regex on HelpOnConfiguration.

The group members are just arbitrary names (unicode strings). Note that groups are not limited to ''user'' names, you can also define a group of your favourite wiki pages (but you would need some code that uses that group in a somehow useful way).

== Wiki Groups ==
=== Defining ===
You can create a group definition for a group named `EditorGroup` by creating a page called `EditorGroup` with this content:

{{{
#format wiki
These are people that are trusted to edit pages on this wiki:
 * JaneDoe
  * this is ignored
 * JoeDoe
 * [[John Smith]]
}}}

Important:
 * Group members have to be on an unordered first-level list.
 * If link markup is used, the link target will be added as member. Please only use rather simple link markup.
 * Everything else (other text, second-level items, etc.) is ignored.
 * You have to explicitly ''use'' the group (there are no hardcoded group names in moin), see below.

=== Usage ===

Use groups to define permissions for those users on your wiki (see HelpOnAccessControlLists).  

For example, you could have this in your wiki config:
{{{
    acl_rights_default = u'EditorGroup:read,write,delete,revert All:read'
}}}


Of course you can also use the group in on-page ACLs:

{{{
#acl EditorGroup:read,write,delete,revert All:read'
}}}

=== Protecting them ===
If your default ACL allows writing for everyone, it is a good idea to protect critical group definition pages with some more restrictive ACL.

E.g. on a group definition page `AdminGroup`:
{{{
#acl AdminGroup:read,write,revert All:read
#format wiki
Members of this group will get admin rights. If you think you should be in this group, contact one of its members to add you.
 * SomeAdmin
 * AnotherAdmin
}}}

As you see: only members of this group may write to the group definition page (and of course everyone who gets write rights from acl_rights_before in the wiki config).

=== Using groups within groups ===
You can also add names of other groups as group members, that is the same as including all their members directly.

== Other ways to define groups / access group definitions ==
!MoinMoin can also use group definitions from other sources, but this needs to be configured in your wiki config. See `groups` on HelpOnConfiguration.
