= Dictionaries =
<<TableOfContents>>
A dictionary is a simple data structure that maps a dictionary name to a set of key/value pairs. It can be used e.g. to provide additional translations.

The dictionary name usually is something like `GermanDict` (some word ending with `Dict`). This default pattern can be changed (e.g. for non-english languages etc.), see page_dict_regex on HelpOnConfiguration.

The dict members are key/value pairs (both unicode strings).

== Wiki Dicts ==
=== Defining them ===
You can create a dict definition for a dict named `GermanDict` by creating a page called `GermanDict` with this content:

{{{
#format wiki
This translates some words from English to German:
 dog:: Hund
 cat:: Katze
 mouse: Maus
}}}

Important:
 * Dict members have to be on a first-level definition list (see HelpOnLists).
  * /!\ The leading space and the space after '::' are important.
 * Everything else (other text, second-level items, etc.) is ignored.

=== Using them ===
==== Translation ====
MoinMoin uses `<Language>Dict` additionally to the builtin gettext based translations. E.g. if it wants to translate `cat` to German and doesn't find it in the .po file, it will try to look it up on `GermanDict` (and find `Katze` there, see the example above).

==== Variables ====
See also HelpOnVariables.

=== Protecting them ===
You can use ACLs as usual to protect your dict pages.

== Other ways to define dicts / access dict definitions ==
!MoinMoin can also use dict definitions from other sources, but this needs to be configured in your wiki config. See `dicts` on HelpOnConfiguration.
