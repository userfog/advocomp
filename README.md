advocomp theme on moinmoin
========

advocomp theme is based on modernized. 

The default css has not been set to advocomp. You must create a new user and change the theme. If you do not see advocomp as a theme, make sure you have the file advocomp.py under MoinMoin/theme/ and the directory advocomp under MoinMoin/web/static/htdocs/. The directory MoinMoin/web/static/htdocs/advocomp also contains the css/ and img/ directories.

Most important configs are in wikiconfig.py. 
Change the site name by finding sitename on line 38. It currently says ```sitename = u'Advo MoinMoin Desktop Edition'``` but you can change it! There are more configs that you can change. Just look at http://moinmo.in/HelpOnConfiguration for more information.
